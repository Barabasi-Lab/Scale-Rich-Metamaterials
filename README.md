# Scale-Rich-Metamaterials

Scale-Rich Metamaterials (SR) are a new class of architected systems that overcome the traditional limitations of periodic or monolithic solids. They exhibit heterogeneity in ligament lengths, thicknesses, and connectivity distributions, generated through the controlled growth of ligaments with prescribed thickness evolution from random nucleation sites.

This repository contains the code used to generate, analyze, and visualize the mechanical and acoustic properties of these heterogeneous structures.
