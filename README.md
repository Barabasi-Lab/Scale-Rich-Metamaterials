# Scale-Rich-Metamaterials

Scale-Rich Metamaterials (SR) are a new class of architected systems that overcome the traditional limitations of periodic or monolithic solids. They exhibit heterogeneity in ligament lengths, thicknesses, and connectivity distributions, generated through the controlled growth of ligaments with prescribed thickness evolution from random nucleation sites.

This repository contains the code used to generate SR architectures and the reference structures (square, hexagonal, and Voronoi lattices) described in `Scale-Rich Network-Based Metamaterials' (Csaba Both, Andrew Yen-Jong Chen, Ting-Ting Gao, Niek Mooij, Mohammad Charara,  Carlos M. Portela, Albert-László Barabási, 2025).
